# multiples
Just a random project I did to generate a JSON object that holds the multiples of a numbers specified by a user.

##Currently being hosted on github pages:

##Notes:
This site was made completely by me just for the purpose of learning, feel free to pick up what you can from this as it may have valuable lessons if you are very new to HTML interacting with js as well as JSON objects.
